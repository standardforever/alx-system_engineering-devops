#          POSTMORTEM

## Written a postmortem

### Requirements:

#### Issue Summary (that is often what executives will read) must contain:
1. duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone)
2. what was the impact (what service was down/slow? What were user experiencing? How many % of the users were affected?)
3. what was the root cause
#### Timeline (format bullet point, format: time - keep it short, 1 or 2 sentences) must contain:

1. when was the issue detected
2. how was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complained…)
3. actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumption on the root cause of the issue)
4. misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken
5. which team/individuals was the incident escalated to
6. how the incident was resolved
#### Root cause and resolution must contain:

1. explain in detail what was causing the issue
2. explain in detail how the issue was fixed
#### Corrective and preventative measures must contain:

1. what are the things that can be improved/fixed (broadly speaking)
2. a list of tasks to address the issue (be very specific, like a TODO, example: patch Nginx server, add monitoring on server memory…)
#### Be brief and straight to the point, between 400 to 600 words
